    <p>WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MY ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD ON THE NEW WEBSITE?
Changing the website you can see meant we had to change some of the systems underpinning it that you can't see. This included the login and registration system, which as well as being new, we have made more secure. If you have visited ManUtd.com recently to buy tickets, you may have been prompted to create a new password when you logged in. If your account details are not recognised when you try to log in, try using the 'forgot password' link. If your email address is not found, then please sign up for a new account.
HOW DO I LOG OUT OF THE WEBSITE?
On a desktop or laptop computer, please follow these steps:

<p>1. Roll your mouse to 'My United' in the website header to open the menu below it</p>
<p>2. Click ‘Settings’ in the menu</p>
<p>3. Select 'My Profile' on the 'Settings' page</p>
<p>4. Click ‘Logout'</p>

<p>On mobiles and other smaller devices:</p>

<p>1. Click the stack of three lines in the website header to open the menu to the side</p>
<p>2. Select ‘My United’ in the menu</p>
<p>3. Click 'Settings'</p>
